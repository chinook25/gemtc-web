          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>
            This is the manual for the GeMTC user interface for network meta-analysis. It starts
            with a brief introduction to network meta-analysis in the Bayesian framework,
            including issues such as model fit and convergence. This is followed
            by a guide to the GeMTC user interface itself. The GeMTC user interface
            uses question mark icon to provide help for specific terms, which when
            clicked will show a brief explanation as well as a link to further information
            in this manual.

            Although this manual contains a brief introduction to the terminology and methodology
            used in GeMTC, it is not a complete guide to network meta-analysis. For

            GeMTC is available as a stand-alone package at <a href="https://gemtc.drugis.org">gemtc.drugis.org</a>,
            and is also part of the <a href="https://addis.drugis.org">ADDIS</a>            decision support system for evidence based medicine, developed at
            <a href="https://drugis.org">drugis.org</a>. The functionality in the
            GeMTC user interface is supported by the <a href="http://drugis.org/software/r-packages/gemtc">GeMTC R package</a>.
            All <a href="https://drugis.org">drugis.org</a> software is open source,
            and source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/drugis/">github.com/drugis</a>.
          </p>

          <h3 id="gemtc-preparing-dataset">Preparing your dataset</h3>
          <p>This section only applies to the stand-alone version of GeMTC, hosted on
            <a href="https://gemtc.drugis.org">https://gemtc.drugis.org/</a>. In
            ADDIS (
            <a href="https://addis.drugis.org/">https://addis.drugis.org/</a>), this
            step is not necessary.</p>
          <p>After signing in to GeMTC, you will be redirected to your personal home
            page. It contains a list of your previously created analyses (which will
            be empty until you create one), and a button to create a new analysis.
            Clicking this button will open the “New analysis” dialog, where you choose
            a title for your analysis and outcome, and upload a dataset file:</p>

          <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <img src="img/gemtc_add_analysis.png" alt="add analysis screen shot" style=" padding: 5px; border: 1px solid gray;">
          </div>

          <p>Datasets can be uploaded in CSV format. The CSV file should contain one
            row per arm, and needs to contain “study” and “treatment” columns, which
            can contain names or identifiers for the study and treatment. The data
            columns may be one of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Continuous data: “mean” and “std.err”</li>
            <li>Continuous data: “mean”, “std.dev”, and “sampleSize”</li>
            <li>Dichotomous data: “responders” and “sampleSize”</li>
            <li>Survival data: “responders” and “exposure” (exposure in person-time)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The following is an example CSV file for a Parkinson’s disease dataset:</p>

          <pre>
          "study","treatment","mean","std.dev","sampleSize"
          "1","A",-1.22,3.7,54
          "1","C",-1.53,4.28,95
          "2","A",-0.7,3.7,172
          "2","B",-2.4,3.4,173
          "3","A",-0.3,4.4,76
          "3","B",-2.6,4.3,71
          "3","D",-1.2,4.3,81
          "4","C",-0.24,3,128

          "5","C",-0.73,3,80
          "5","D",-0.18,3,46
          "6","D",-2.2,2.31,137

          <h4 id="gemtc-data-covariates">Including covariates in the dataset</h4>

          <p>To include covariates in a dataset, simply add additional columns to the
            CSV file, but do not to use any of the column names already recognized
            by GeMTC (study, treatment, mean, etc.). Covariates are currently only
            considered at the study level. Therefore, you can include these data
            in one of two different ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Specify the covariate value for only one of the study arms, and leave
              it as missing or "NA" for the others.</li>
            <li>Specify the covariate value for all arms of the study, making sure that
              each arm within a study has the same value as the other arms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="gemtc-data-contrast-based">Including contrast-based data</h4>

          <p>Contrast based data (e.g. log odds ratios) can also be analyzed in GeMTC.
            Datasets can contain both contrast-based and arm-based data, but any
            single study must be either completely contrast-based or completely arm-based.
            Contrast based data are effect estimates and their standard errors on
            a specific scale (e.g. mean difference or log-odds ratio); that scale
            must be specified when uploading contrast-based data.</p>

          <p>Contrast-based data are also specified using the one arm per row format.
            For every arm except the base arm, specify the effect estimate and its
            standard error in the columns "re.diff" and "re.diff.se". For the base
            arm, these columns must be left as missing or "NA".</p>

          <p>In multi-arm (that is, more than 2 arms) trials, the treatment contrasts
            are correlated. This must be accounted for in the likelihood. To do this,
            the standard error of the (absolute) effect in the base arm must be specified
            in the column "re.base.se". For example, if the outcome scale is the
            log-odds ratio, this is the standard error of the absolute log-odds in
            the base arm. By a convenient statistical coincidence, the standard error
            of the base arm squared is equal to the covariance between the treatment
            contrasts. Thus, if the covariance is known, set "re.base.se" to the
            square root of the covariance.</p>

          <p>There are a number of caveats when using contrast-based data. First, as
            the number of participants is not known for this data, the size of nodes
            in the evidence graph does not reflect the number of participants. Second,
            the scale at which the relative effects were computed will restrict the
            available likelihoods. Third, model fit statistics for contrast-based
            data are not computed at the arm level, but at the study level.</p>
